# Uplift Web-App Final
---------------
#
#
##### Uplift is a web-app accessibility utility developed using Postgres, Express, React, Node.js, and Jade.
##### The goal of the tool is to allow users to crowdsource data about additional assistive technologies offered by some businesses that aren't easily searchable for on other business/service-finding platforms.

### Apis 
---------------
#
#
##### To source the majority of the data in the first build of the project I'll be relying on User input, but have so far been able to provide some initial data for hotel chains in other countries that provide Hoyer Lifts on-site for guests who cannot transfer out of their chairs on their own. 
#
### Apis that will be utilized during the first build:
##### 1. **Auth0** for user sign-up and log-in
##### 2. **Mapbox: Static Images** for individual business page maps
##### 3. **Mapbox: Static Tiles** where multiple businesses appear close to each other in intial search
#
#
#

##### These are a few wireframes of page templates I want to use after deploying the app
